Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY, PARTICLE, SUPPORT_GSL
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================


Note:
========================================
1. You can put many clouds of particles in HYDRO mode, and observe their evolution through gravity.
   To assign the number of clouds, input the desired number in variable "Cloud_Num" in "Init_TestProb".
   And please input the file names of physical parameters in "Input__TestProb" for each cloud respectively.
2. Test the evolution of the all sorts of models, like Plummer, NFW, Burkert, Jaffe, Hernquist, Einasto
   To switch among the types of models, find variable "Cloud_Type" in your physical parameter files.
   Available options include:
   Plummer
   NFW
   Burkert
   Jaffe
   Hernquist
   Einasto
   Table
   If you want to initialize a model with some given density profile in the form of a table, please use option "Table",and input
      your file name after variable "Density_Table_Name" in your physical parameter files; otherwise input "NONE" in it.
3. Sometimes the spatial resolution is not small enough for some models like Jaffe, please increase MAX_LEVEL in "Input__Parameter"
4. You construct multiple clouds of particles at the same time.
   Replace the original Input__TestProb with the content of Input_TestProb_Two_Clouds for example, will allow you to construct two clouds of particles.
   For details, you may check Input__TestProb for further instructions.
5. To generate example density or external potential tables, you may use the python files in "tool/table_maker/" to build your tables.
